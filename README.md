# Zmux-Sessionizer
Trying to develop a Tmux Plugin for creating and opening custom sessions.
You can check [here](https://github.com/MrSloth-dev/.dotfiles/blob/main/scripts/zmux.sh) the shell script that was the origin of the idea for this plugin.

Thank you [Zappa](https://github.com/PedroZappa) for the idea and teaching the ways of tmux!
