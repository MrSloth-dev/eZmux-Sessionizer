# Zmux-Sessionizer
Trying to develop a Tmux Plugin for creating and opening custom sessions.
You can check [here](https://github.com/MrSloth-dev/.dotfiles/blob/main/scripts/zmux.sh) the shell script that was the origin of the idea for this plugin.

# Roadmap | TODO
- [ ] Create Yaml File configuration to get better reading and creating experience
- [ ] Create Session with `zmux <session_name>`
  - [ ] Assign root directory
  - [ ] Create Normal Windows and rename them
  - [ ] Create Windows with different Panes
  - [ ] Send Commands to each pane
- [ ] `zmux` without args list all available sessions opened and in the configuration file
- [ ] Sugestions are welcome!


Thank you [Zappa](https://github.com/PedroZappa) for the idea and teaching the ways of tmux!
